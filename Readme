Title: Homework for Eaton.
Author: Oleksii Zaporozhets.

1. General
Developed application consists of 2 parts: server and client.
Client part is responsible for generation measurements and sending them
to the server on behalf of different clients. Each message contains
client name and measurements result.
Server part is responsible for getting messages from clients and store
them in database accumulating number of messages from each client. It
shows this number in real time.

2. Compilation
Server and client parts are compiled separately. To compile each of them,
please run "make all" command from server and client folder respectively.
As the result of compilation, 2 executables with the same names will be
created. Program is written in ANSI C and C++ languages, so both gcc and
g++ compilers are required to be intalled.

3. Running
To run application under Linux OS, please use "./<app_name> <port_num>",
where <app_name> is "server" or "client" depending on which part you'd
like to run, <port_num> is number of TCP port to send data (for the client)
or listen (for the server) in decimal format.
Note: server part has to be started before client.
Note: application supports multiple clients, but only one server must exist
at a time.

4. Restrictions
Server part supports up to 50 parallel connections. This number might be
reduced by OS in case of lack of resources.
Message length is limited to 256 bytes and client name to 253 bytes.
Application provides only basic error checks, so please use correct input
parameters. Please try "./<app_name>" for usage message.
Application uses localhost address (127.0.0.1), so both parts are required
to be run on the same host.
